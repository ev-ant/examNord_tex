# examNord_tex

This is a LaTeX template for producing Exam tasks.
The usage of template ensures a compliance with requirements as they are in Spring 2018.

To minimize possible inconveniences in both providing and understanding a full instruction for istallation of package, it is STRONGLY adviced to use it in "from the folder" way.

For this, all folder "examNord_tex" should be downloaded into a folder for further use.

To create a new exam text:

- copy a `template.tex` file and rename it according to requirements;
- keep a new `<course_code>.tex` in THE SAME FOLDER.
- inside this `.tex`-file change necessary fields.
- typeset and enjoy.

!!! OBS
Do not change any of included folders, subfolders or/and files, unless you are fully aware of forthcoming effects.
